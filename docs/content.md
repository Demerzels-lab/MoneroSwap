## How It Works Section

### Title
How MoneroSwap Works

### Subtitle
Four simple steps to complete privacy-preserving swaps

### Steps

#### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
Connect MetaMask for EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC) or Phantom for Solana. Your keys never leave your browser.

#### Step 2: Select Your Tokens
Choose from 20+ supported tokens across 7 blockchains. Our smart routing finds the best rates automatically.

#### Step 3: Privacy Protocol Activates
Behind the scenes, Monero's ring signature technology kicks in. Your transaction becomes untraceable and unlinkable.

#### Step 4: Atomic Swap Executes
Trustless hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) ensure both parties fulfill their obligations. No middlemen, no custody.

## Technology Section

### Title
Powered by Monero Privacy Technology

### Subtitle
Understanding the cryptographic innovations that make truly private transactions possible

### The Problem with Traditional Crypto
Most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have transparent blockchains. Every transaction is publicly visible, creating a permanent record that can be:

- **Traced**: Anyone can follow the flow of funds
- **Linked**: Addresses can be connected to real identities
- **Analyzed**: Companies build profiles on your financial activity
- **Censored**: Transactions can be blocked based on history

### Monero's Solution: Privacy by Default

#### Ring Signatures
Your transaction is cryptographically mixed with decoy transactions. It's impossible to determine which input was actually spent.

**How it works:**
- When you spend XMR, your signature is grouped with 10+ other possible signers
- All signatures appear equally likely to be the real one
- Even advanced blockchain analysis cannot determine the true sender

#### Stealth Addresses
Every transaction creates a unique, one-time address for the recipient. Even if you publish your address, incoming transactions cannot be linked to it.

**Benefits:**
- Receiving address is never recorded on blockchain
- Sender cannot see recipient's balance
- Multiple payments to same person look unrelated

#### RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions)
Transaction amounts are encrypted using Pedersen commitments. The network can verify transactions are valid without knowing the actual values.

**What's hidden:**
- Exact amount being sent
- Change returned to sender
- All amounts appear as encrypted blobs

#### Bulletproofs
Zero-knowledge range proofs that verify encrypted amounts are positive without revealing them. This keeps transactions small and fees low.

**Advantages:**
- 80% smaller than previous proofs
- Faster verification
- Lower transaction fees

### Why MoneroSwap Matters

| Problem | Traditional DEX | MoneroSwap |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Transaction Visibility | Fully public | Encrypted & mixed |
| Address Linkability | Easily traced | Stealth addresses |
| Amount Privacy | Visible to all | Hidden via RingCT |
| KYC Requirements | Often required | Never required |
| Censorship Resistance | Partial | Complete |

## FAQ Section

### Questions

#### What is MoneroSwap?
MoneroSwap is a decentralized exchange that enables privacy-preserving atomic swaps between different cryptocurrencies using Monero's ring signature technology.

#### How does privacy work?
We utilize Monero's ring signatures to mix your transaction with decoy transactions, making it impossible to trace the actual sender. Stealth addresses ensure recipient privacy, and RingCT hides transaction amounts.

#### Which wallets are supported?
Currently, we support MetaMask for all EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism) and Phantom for Solana.

#### Is KYC required?
No. MoneroSwap never requires any personal information. We don't collect emails, phone numbers, or identification documents.

#### What tokens can I swap?
We support 20+ tokens including ETH, SOL, XMR, USDC, USDT, DAI, LINK, UNI, AAVE, WBTC, MATIC, BNB, AVAX, and more. Check our documentation for the full list.

#### Are swaps instant?
Swap times vary by blockchain. Most EVM swaps complete within 1-5 minutes. Cross-chain swaps involving Bitcoin or Monero may take 10-30 minutes due to confirmation requirements.

#### What are the fees?
MoneroSwap charges a 0.3% swap fee. You also pay the standard network gas fees for your transactions.

#### Is MoneroSwap audited?
Yes, our smart contracts are audited by leading security firms. All audit reports are publicly available in our documentation.

#### Can I use MoneroSwap on mobile?
Yes, MoneroSwap is fully responsive and works with mobile wallet browsers like MetaMask Mobile and Phantom Mobile.

#### How do atomic swaps work?
Atomic swaps use hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) to ensure trustless exchange. Both parties lock their assets simultaneously, and the swap either completes for both or neither.
